♻️ Waste Material Classification Using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based waste classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It classifies waste into categories like biodegradable, recyclable, etc., to support intelligent waste management systems and environmental sustainability.

📌 Overview

Waste segregation is a crucial step in efficient recycling and environmental conservation. This project leverages CNNs to automatically classify images of waste into different categories. It uses TensorFlow/Keras for modeling and is designed to run smoothly on platforms like Google Colab.
